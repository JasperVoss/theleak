				<h2>McDonald's Restaurants in Milwaukee Area See 110% Increase in Number of Danish Customers Over the Course of Two Weeks</h2>
				<time datetime="03-18-2020">March 18, 2020</time>
				<p>
					"We used to have a steady proportion of ethnicities year round," McDonald's CEO Don Thompson tells Leak reporters, "but all that has changed in the last couple of weeks." Publicized reports of McDonald's sales delineate this proportion - they often see an influx in the number of Scandinavian customers around this time of year (as well as an increase in the number of Aussie customers in October and a surprisingly low Native American count around June, for unknown or unpublicized reasons), but it has never been this extreme.
				</p>
				<p>
					"In fact, some of our most loyal customers are Danish, but we are really concerned about them flooding out other demographics, so we are considering a company-wide ban on Danes," says Thompson. He also specifies that the customers themselves are in fact Danish and they are not simply buying danishes. "We don't make pastries. That would be weird," he says. "I don't even like danishes."
				</p>
				<p>
					Scientists have some ideas as to how phenomenons like these arise in the fast food industry, and a new field has been created, dubbed "fast-food-induced foreign-influx population biology." See the Wikipedia page titled the same for more information.

				<h2>Dow Dips into Negative Numbers for a Quick Scare, Recovers</h2>
				<time datetime="03-17-2020">March 17, 2020</time>
				<p>
					On Wednesday, the Dow took a brief tumble from 22,000 points down to -191, but recovered within the span of 8 minutes and continued on an upward trend for the remainder of a day. Economists everywhere are reeling, including one internet user by the name of "hendricks," who said the following on Yahoo Answers in 2016, in response to an inquiry as to whether the Dow could ever hit zero:
				</p>
				<p>
					"What you advise is impossible because of the fact for the DOW to hit 0 could advise that there is not any fee by any skill interior the businesses. whether all of them went out of enterprise, there are present factors interior the form of automobiles, desktops, etc., that have some fee. even if, we could all "sense" like the DOW has hit 0 till now that's over."
				</p>
					Another Yahoo Answers user by the name of "HGSTFPOSBTTMCB" had a considerably more morbid tone to his answer, saying "the world blows up. we all die."
				<p>
					Clearly, this is an unprecedented event, and nobody really knows what it meant. Nobel-prize winning economist Daniel Kahneman tells us that he "thought he owed a lot of people a lot of money," but didn't know quite who or why. He says that economists are "choosing to ignore it and just pretend it didn't happen," and presumably hope it doesn't happen again. The Dow is up today by 4.8 percent.

				<h2>Major News Sources Unsure of what They Talked About Before Coronavirus</h2>
				<time datetime="03-15-2020">March 15, 2020</time>
				<p>
					With the never ending stream of recent news, it would seem that the world's news sources would be doing well. "But they're not," CNN CEO Jeff Zucker explained to us. "Frankly we're having an internal crisis - we're not sure what we used to talk about before coronavirus came about. We're not sure how we're going to continue publishing content after it's over."
				</p>
				<p>
					Zucker is not alone, either. CEO of Fox News, Roger Ailes, explained to us their internal struggle to dig up archived content in order to review it. 
				</p>
				<p>
					"Obviously there's no shortage of material right now." Ailes told us. "But we're just not sure how long that's going to last, and we're afraid that we've lost our ability to make nothing sound like something. It's getting to the point where we're kind of hoping that this virus continues for a while. Sorry, that's off the record, right?"
				</p>
				<p>
					"I hope we're not missing anything important." Zucker continued. "We used to be able to report everyday without coronavirus. Now it's all we report on. What used to happen?"
