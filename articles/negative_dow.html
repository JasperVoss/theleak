				<h2>Dow Dips into Negative Numbers for a Quick Scare, Recovers</h2>
				<time datetime="03-17-2020">March 17, 2020</time>
				<p>
					On Wednesday, the Dow took a brief tumble from 22,000 points down to -191, but recovered within the span of 8 minutes and continued on an upward trend for the remainder of a day. Economists everywhere are reeling, including one internet user by the name of "hendricks," who said the following on Yahoo Answers in 2016, in response to an inquiry as to whether the Dow could ever hit zero:
				</p>
				<p>
					"What you advise is impossible because of the fact for the DOW to hit 0 could advise that there is not any fee by any skill interior the businesses. whether all of them went out of enterprise, there are present factors interior the form of automobiles, desktops, etc., that have some fee. even if, we could all "sense" like the DOW has hit 0 till now that's over."
				</p>
				<p>
					Another Yahoo Answers user by the name of "HGSTFPOSBTTMCB" had a considerably more morbid tone to his answer, saying "the world blows up. we all die."
				</p>
				<p>
					Clearly, this is an unprecedented event, and nobody really knows what it meant. Nobel-prize winning economist Daniel Kahneman tells us that he "thought he owed a lot of people a lot of money," but didn't know quite who or why. He says that economists are "choosing to ignore it and just pretend it didn't happen," and presumably hope it doesn't happen again. The Dow is up today by 4.8 percent.
