				<h2>Student who Found Dream Career as Deep Sea Alaskan Fisherman After Naviance Recommendation Shows Off Latest Catch</h2>
				<time datetime="03-16-2020">March 16, 2020</time>
				<p>
					<em><b>Sitka, Alaska</b></em><b> - </b>Tracy Hartman seemed like an average teenager who was going to have a typical life. Graduate High School, Graduate College, forget it all and get a meaningless job, telling herself that it's only temporary, until she's sixty five and collecting her 401k. But that's not how it went down. 
				</p>
				<p>
					It was her sophomore year when she was called down to the second floor computer lab for a guidance meeting. "They were having us use the career cluster finder on Naviance" she recalls. "I told the computer what I was interested in. I thought it was normal. It turns out it wasn't - I was the only one in the school that they recommended Deep Sea Fishing for. Like most teens I had never thought of that as a career."
				</p>
				<p>
					Tracy throws the anchor off the side of the boat. The waves slapped at our ankles as we continued with the interview. I asked her what made this seem like a viable career.
				</p>
				<p>
					"It didn't seem that way at first. It's hard for me to admit, but it didn't interest me at all. It wasn't until my guidance counselor strongly recommended that I don't pay attention to that career recommendation that it began to sound appealing." She droned on, but  I couldn't hear her over the smell of dead fish. She got up, gesturing for me to follow. Reaching down into the stern well of the boat, she pulled out her latest catch - a 54 pound albacore tuna, crimson blood running down its gills, reminding me that not too long ago its heart was beating. Tracy shot me a smile. "This'll go for a hundred ten easy."

					"For all those young folk out there," she starts in her acquired Alaskan accent, "Naviance might know you better than you know yourself. Don't shrug it off."
