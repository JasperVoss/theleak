				<h2>Student Fails Selfridge's Reading Quiz Despite Having Read Sparknotes</h2>
				<time datetime="03-18-2020">March 18, 2020</time>
				<p>
					Senior Bentley Robinson hadn't done the reading homework for his AP Literature class with Mr. Selfridge, but he figured it wouldn't be a problem. He had read the sparknotes for the chapters, and he had read them carefully.
				</p>
				<p>
					"If it's not important, it's not in the Sparknotes, and it's not on the reading quiz." Robinson told us. "Besides, Sparknotes is written in a way that you can understand even if you don't speak old English, unlike most of the reading we do."
				</p>
				<p>
					As expected, as they entered the classroom they were told to separate their desks and take out a pencil. If they had taken notes on the reading, they could use them as well. Robinson stayed calm; he had understood what happened in the chapter. He got a little nervous upon reading the first question. <em>What did Tom give to Daisy and where did she put it?</em> But it only got worse from there. Each question was harder than the last, and by the end he understood that he had failed, despite having read the Sparknotes meticulously. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Mr. Selfridge refused to comment on any individual student's grades, although he did tell us that he has met Stevie Wonder.
