				<h2>Camderson Rally Draws Record Numbers Despite Virus Fears</h2>
				<time datetime="03-14-2020">March 14, 2020</time>
				<p>
					<b>Madison Square Garden, New York - </b>Juniors Amitai Cammy and Emmet Anderson, better known as Camderson, gained publicity when they were the first treasurers elected across class lines, winning the position of Freshman Class Treasurers. Since then, their chaotic rallies and impressive speeches have brought them to become even better known throughout New England. That's why it's no surprise that they have drawn impressive crowds to their rallies.

					The rally that they had planned for this Saturday was different though. Due to fears of coronavirus, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo had banned all gatherings of more than five hundred people. That wasn't going to stop the dynamic duo or their energetic fans, though. Besides, they had campaigning to do given the upcoming elections.
				</p>
				<p>
					By the time that our reporters arrived to the scene in Madison Square Garden, there were already an estimated 3000 people filling the stands, and about ten National Guard members trying to disperse the crowd. Anderson started by cracking a joke, bringing the duo into their routine. They were winning votes, and there was no stopping them. 
				</p>
				<p>
					It has just been reported that at least six atendees have tested positive for COVID-19, something that apparently doesn't bother Camderson.
				</p>
				<p>
					"They knew what they were doing. The people decided that seeing us outweighed the potential consequences. I wouldn't disagree." Amitai told us. "This is about showing the pandemic who's in charge."
				</p>
				<p>
					It is unclear which class treasurer position Camderson will be running for this Spring. They told us that they would rather keep that information private.
