				<h2>McDonald's restaurants in Milwaukee area see 110% increase in number of Danish customers over the course of two weeks</h2>
				<time datetime="03-12-2020">March 18, 2020</time>
				<p>
					"We used to have a steady proportion of ethnicities year round," McDonald's CEO Don Thompson tells Leak reporters, "but all that has changed in the last couple of weeks." Publicized reports of McDonald's sales delineate this proportion - they often see an influx in the number of Scandinavian customers around this time of year (as well as an increase in the number of Aussie customers in October and a surprisingly low Native American count around June, for unknown or unpublicized reasons), but it has never been this extreme.
				</p>
				<p>
					"In fact, some of our most loyal customers are Danish, but we are really concerned about them flooding out other demographics, so we are considering a company-wide ban on Danes," says Thompson. He also specifies that the customers themselves are in fact Danish and they are not simply buying danishes. "We don't make pastries. That would be weird," he says. "I don't even like danishes."
				</p>
				<p>
					Scientists have some ideas as to how phenomenons like these arise in the fast food industry, and a new field has been created, dubbed "fast-food-induced foreign-influx population biology." See the Wikipedia page titled the same for more information.
